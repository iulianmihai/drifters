        <p class="h1">Welcome to Indianapolis Drifters Website!</p>
        <p class="h4 text-quote">As National President, I welcome you to The Drifters, Incorporated website! With over 600 membership volunteers in 35 chapters across the United States, we pledge to continue our legacy of giving and service in our respective communities.</p>
        <div class="homepage-content">
          <p>We hope you will find this site informative, easy to use and full of resources about what we do on behalf of those we serve in our communities.</p>
          <p>The Drifters, Incorporated was founded over 63 years ago thanks to a legacy of women “driftin” from one city to another.  We have established a Sisterhood that this year will celebrate its 62nd Annual Convention.</p>
          <p>While collectively we are focused on voter registration and education this year, we continue our pledge of Service and Sisterhood and promote our national theme, “Strengthen our families to build better communities” with sub themes: “Save our children – Assist our seniors.”</p>
          <p>We hope this website exemplifies all of our concepts and inspires you to embrace them as well.   Our goals can only be accomplished with the assistance of outside entities.  We need the support of business, corporations and companies willing to work alongside our organization that has established itself for over six decades to enrich our communities, children and seniors.  We are ready to work with you to support our endeavors to continue our legacy of Service and Sisterhood; we welcome you as a partner and friend.</p>
          <p>Please, enjoy the website!  We request your feedback and we encourage you to come back often and visit the site again, and again, and again.   If you are interested in learning more about us and contributing to our illustrious history of giving and service, please click the “Contact Us” tab and send us your information.</p>
          <p>As National President, I invite you to join our dedicated membership to support our themes.  You have taken the first step by visiting our website…why not take the next step and become part of our legacy!</p>
          <p>Sincerely,<br>Denise L. Taylor-Hill<br>National President<br>The Drifters, Incorporated</p>
